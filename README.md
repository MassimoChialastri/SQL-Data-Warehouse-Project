## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows the **Medallion Architecture** with **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:

![Data Architecture](docs/data_architecture.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into the SQL Server database with no transformations applied.
2. **Silver Layer**: Includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a galaxy star schema optimized for reporting and analytics.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse using Medallion Architecture (**Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers).
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries (galaxy star schema).
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.
5. **Power BI Report**: Building an end-to-end interactive Power BI report connected to the Gold layer, delivering visual insights on customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.

🎯 This repository is an excellent resource for professionals and students looking to showcase expertise in:
- SQL Development (T-SQL)
- Data Architecture
- Data Engineering
- ETL Pipeline Development
- Data Modeling
- Data Analytics
- Power BI Reporting

## 📦 Dataset

This project uses the **Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist**, publicly available on Kaggle.

> 📥 **Download the dataset:** [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)

The dataset contains real anonymized commercial data from orders placed on the Olist e-commerce platform in Brazil between 2016 and 2018. It covers the full order lifecycle — from purchase to delivery and customer review — across multiple interconnected tables:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `customers.csv` | Customer information including location (city, state) and unique identifiers |
| `geolocation.csv` | Geolocation data mapping Brazilian zip codes to latitude/longitude coordinates |
| `orders.csv` | Order-level data including status, purchase timestamp, and delivery dates |
| `order_items.csv` | Details of each item within an order (product, seller, price, freight) |
| `order_payments.csv` | Payment information per order (type, installments, value) |
| `order_reviews.csv` | Customer reviews including scores and comments submitted after delivery |
| `products.csv` | Product attributes such as category, dimensions, and weight |
| `product_category_name_translation.csv` | Translation of product category names from Portuguese to English |
| `sellers.csv` | Seller information including location (city, state) |

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from the Brazilian e-commerce platform **Olist**, provided as CSV files (customers, orders, order items, payments, reviews, products, sellers, geolocation).
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

#### Objective
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
- **Customer Behavior**
- **Product Performance**
- **Sales Trends**

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
